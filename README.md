## Abstract

The equitable distribution of healthcare personnel is tailored to the ideal needs of each region, encompassing both primary and advanced healthcare services. Indonesia faces challenges regarding healthcare worker distribution, which vary by socio-economic conditions, regional policies, and national oversight, particularly in remote areas. This study identifies factors influencing the distribution of doctors across East Java in 2022, such as population size, poverty percentage, and healthcare facilities.

## Introduction

Healthcare personnel are crucial in delivering health services. Indonesia faces regional disparities in healthcare worker distribution due to socio-economic and policy differences. Effective healthcare delivery requires proper distribution of personnel across urban and rural areas, with a focus on addressing shortages in underserved regions.

## Methodology

This research is based on secondary data from the *"Health Profile of East Java 2022."* Data from 38 districts/cities in East Java were analyzed using a quantitative approach and cross-tabulation to identify the factors influencing the distribution of doctors. 

The key variables analyzed include:
- Number of Doctors (General practitioners, dentists, and specialists)
- Population Size
- Population Density
- Poverty Percentage
- Number of Hospitals
- Number of Health Centers (Puskesmas)

## Results

The study revealed variations in doctor distribution across regions. A positive relationship was observed between the number of doctors and factors such as population size, population density, the number of hospitals, and health centers. The relationship with the poverty percentage varied, suggesting that further research is needed in this area.

## Conclusion

The distribution of doctors in East Java is positively correlated with population size, population density, the number of hospitals, and the number of health centers. Despite these correlations, inequities persist, particularly in remote areas. Policies like the *Nusantara Sehat Program* can play a role in improving doctor distribution and retaining healthcare professionals in underserved areas.
